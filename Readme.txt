# Exceptional work
-> I have used openTriviaDB api to dynamically get the the data from the server

-> I have then stored all the data in the arrays and used Sessions to carry data
-> from one page to another.

-> Inorder to get the data I have created the URL from scratch using URL object 

->  Lots of operators are used to make the app functional.
